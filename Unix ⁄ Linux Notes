What is Kernel ?
Ans: The computer program that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is called the OS or the Kernel. Users communcate with the OS through a program called Shell.


What is a Shell?
And: A shell is Command Line Interpreter(CLI).It is a utility tool that processes your requests to do typical operations like file manipulation, program execution, and printing text, etc. It translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the Kernel or OS.

Shell is broadly classified into two categories –
    1) Command Line Shell - executing tasks or programs via commands.
    2) Graphical shell - executing the task via Graphics; like we close window using X button.


What is Shell script ?
Ans: The basic concept of a shell is a list of cmds which are listed in the order of execution.

Some basic cmds used in linux:
    ls    - lists all the directory contents
    cat   - concatenate files and print on the standard output
    clear - to clear the terminal.
    exit  - to exit the terminal

There are several shells are available for Linux systems like –

    BASH (Bourne Again SHell) : It is most widely used shell in Linux systems. It is used as default login shell in Linux systems and in macOS. It can also be installed on Windows OS.

    CSH (C SHell) : The C shell’s syntax and usage are very similar to the C programming language.

    KSH (Korn SHell) : The Korn Shell also was the base for the POSIX Shell standard specifications etc.
